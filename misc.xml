You can use markdown to make your messages more expressive. This is the markdown currently supported:

<code>{1}</code> backticks allow you to wrap your words in monospace fonts. Shows as: <code>code words</code>
<code>*bold words*</code> asterixes are used for bold font. Shows as: <b>bold words</b>
<code>_italic words_</code> underscores are used for italics. Shows as: <i>italic words</i>
<code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code> this is used for hyperlinks, and will show as such: <a href="example.com">hyperlink</a>. Make sure not to add any extra spaces between the ] and the ( or it won't be valid markdown.

Now, if you wanted to have buttons on your message, you could use this special syntax:
<code>[button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
This will create a button named "button" which redirects the user to <code>example.com</code> upon clicking.
If you would like to add two buttons on the same row, add <code>:same</code> at the end of your link; it'll set it on the same line as the other one. For example:
<code>[button](buttonurl://example.com)
[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)
[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
will create two buttons on the same line (buttons 1 and 2), and a last one (button 3) on a second line.

Try these out on notes, filters, welcome messages or even rules!
